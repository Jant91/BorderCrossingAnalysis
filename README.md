# Border Crossing Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the movement of people and goods across borders by analyzing border crossing entry data.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises information on border crossings, including port names, states, border types, dates, types of crossing, and the number of crossings.

## Key Features
The analysis includes the following key features:
- Time Series Analysis on different transportation methods.
- Comparative Analysis of border crossings by state and transportation measure.
- Geospatial Analysis to visualize crossing points on a map.
- Forecasting future trends using ARIMA models.
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly.

## Technologies Used
The project is developed using the following technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
- Statsmodels for time series analysis.
- Basemap for geospatial visualization.
- Plotly for interactive plots.

## Setup and Installation


## Usage
To view the analysis and visualizations, run the Jupyter Notebook `border_crossing_analysis.ipynb`.

## Results
The analysis provides valuable insights into border crossing trends, including:
- Trends in border crossings over time.
- Comparison of crossing frequencies by transportation method and state.
- Geographical distribution of border crossing points.
- Forecasted trends in border crossings.

## Conclusion
This analysis is crucial in decision-making for border management and policy planning.
